Problem: I set goals every year… but I forget them or stop tracking progress.

Solution: Rsolution tracker App

What it solves?
	I can write and save my goals in this app and can track my progress.


schema:
	.title
	.discription
	.goal (300 hours of reading reading)
	.dailyTarget (5 mintues of reading)
	.progress
	.createdAt
	.status (In progress, completed)
	.type (resolution, daliy task)
